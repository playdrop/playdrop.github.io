{"name":"playdrop","tagline":"Making saving water fun","body":"#Playdrop\r\n\r\nPlaydrop aims to make saving water fun. Using distributed sensors in your home you can know exactly how much water you use, and where you use it. You will be able to compete with family members and neighbours. Be the best water saver in town! (Oh, and avoid losing your house to a water leak, using the alert and remote shutoff functionality.)\r\n \r\nMeet us at [Makerfaire UK](http://www.makerfaireuk.com/) where we present a proof-of-concept/prototype built on the [Linkit ONE](https://labs.mediatek.com/site/global/developer_tools/mediatek_linkit/whatis_linkit/index.gsp) platform that includes cloud-based water metering, flood warnings per SMS, and remote shutoff. The initial version was built using the Arduino IDE plugin, before switching to the freshly released native Mediatek SDK.","google":"UA-62265751-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
